If you want to get around the city like Audubon park, lower garden district or Bayou St John or Treme itâ€™s not the most walking friendly and in the summer it would be unbearable. There is the street car which can take you to a good amount of places. But Uber and Lyft are also readily available and easy to use',\n",

Nothing wrong with those cities, but there is so much more to our country.\\nThe French Quarter is very walkable, and if itâ€™s your first time in the city youâ€™ll be busy enough there you wonâ€™t need to leave.',\n",

They have buses but we didn't really use them. Can always rent a bicycle too. Uber is available if you're under a time constraints and need to be somewhere faster. \\n\\nAlso if you plan on seeing a plantation or alligator boat rides. Those companies that do them have shuttles and so pickups at multiple locations around the city.\",\n",

I was there solo one time for a job interview, asked the bartender if it was fine for me to be walking back along Tchopitoulas back to my hostel in the Garden District, and he was like \"um... no.\"\\n\\nBut the main tourist areas are plenty walkable particularly during the day, and the streetcar connects the Garden District to the French Quarter, which is handy.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t go during Mardi Gras.  It\\'s absolutely insane.  And particularly as you\\'re from Europe, don\\'t going during the summer.  It is like walking on the surface of the sun if the surface of the sun were humid.\\n\\nIt\\'s a fantastic fun city though, and the music comes from everywhere.  It is not uncommon to have buskers on the street with separate people dancing in the street to the buskers.
