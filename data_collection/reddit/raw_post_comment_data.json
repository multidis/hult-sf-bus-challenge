    "title": "Why do people like Las Vegas?",
    "text": "This subreddit notoriously hates Dubai and Disneyland, yet has no issue with folks including Vegas in their itineraries. Yet as an American I've been to Las Vegas once and was ready to leave after about 2 hours (well, maybe add one more hour for the neon museum)--Fremont street lasted me a whole 5 minutes.\n\nSo for those who line up with this subreddit's usual priorities, what's the appeal in Las Vegas? What makes it worth visiting in a way Dubai isn't?",
    "comments_lev1": [
      "If you are a frequent business traveler you can\u2019t escape Vegas. Conferences like to book there because they almost never run out of hotel rooms. The same number of travelers would paralyze most cities.",
      "Vegas gets slammed here *all* the time too. You're not alone.\n\nTo each their own, it's nothing to worry about.\n\nHappy travels.",
      "People who take the time to post on travel forums often pan Vegas for being \u201cinauthentic\u201d\n\nI say that\u2019s complete crap.  \n\nLas Vegas is authentic as it gets.  If you go to Las Vegas expecting a European culturally rich experience you\u2019re going for the wrong reasons.  Nobody at Caesar\u2019s thinks they\u2019re in Ancient Rome.  The city is a playground and ranges from the most opulent Americana can offer to a seedy underworld.  There\u2019s plenty of organized crime folklore that\u2019s romantic in an odd way.  That is its culture.  \n\nThere\u2019s amazing entertainment every single night.  There\u2019s good food from hole in the wall joints off the beaten paths to celebrity chefs.  It\u2019s become a center for sports and being around other fans.  Watching NFL football, or any other sport in Vegas is an amazing experience.  \n\nThere\u2019s something for everyone in Las Vegas.  There\u2019s plenty of great nature not too far from the city.  \n\nPeople need to set realistic expectations of their travels.  Don\u2019t go to Vegas for 3 days and expect it to be the same vacation as an 18 day tour of Southeast Asia.",
      "I can fly to Vegas direct. Watch an f1 race and nfl game within walking distance of nice hotels. Get in, see nice shows, and get out. What's not to like? If I want nature or culture, I'll go elsewhere, but for what it is, it fits.",
      "I love sports and gambling and good food and drinks and people watching and pools and live music",
      "Well for starters I\u2019m not going to get locked up in Vegas for holding my partner\u2019s hand or smoking a joint. \n\nVegas is generally much more tolerant of letting people do whatever they want. Dubai is more known for being a place you can enjoy luxury in a controlled, secure environment. People compare the two because they are tourist destinations in desert climates but they are very different culturally and don\u2019t have much in common other than nice hotels and weather.",
      "I like Vegas since there\u2019s plenty to do and shop. Great shows and it\u2019s beautiful at night. The hotels are appealing and beautifully designed.",
      "Dubai is in a category of its own due to the human rights issues involved.\n\nI also don\u2019t think it\u2019s true that this sub inherently hates Disney - it\u2019s just not how the vast majority of the people here choose to travel.  Going to Disney, if that\u2019s what you like, is no more or less stupid than going to the same foreign city over and over again, if that\u2019s what you like.  Life is too short to worry about other people\u2019s preferences\u2026and most people here know that.  Las Vegas falls into this category as well.  If you like shows, gambling, and cheap buffets, then have at it.",
      "Vegas companies don\u2019t take their workers\u2019 passports and force them to stay. Only go to Dubai if you believe modern day slavery is acceptable",
      "Why am I not surprised someone with the username harpsichord dude doesn\u2019t like Vegas? \n\nVegas is fun if you have money and like general debauchery like gambling, alcohol, cocaine, nightclubs, strippers, etc. \n\nOutside of that there is world class food, shows, shopping, concerts, festivals and hiking. And a bunch of art, professional sports, quirky exhibits etc. \n\nBut go ahead and skip it if none of that appeals to you! To each their own\u2026 and enjoy that harpsichord!",
      "Disneyland is a destination that offers essentially one thing. If you aren't going there to enjoy the theme parks or bring people who will, I don't know why you'd go there.\n\nDubai (aside from the serious ethical issues) isn't a domestic trip for all but .001% of the population and also has strict laws and restrictions that apply depending on race and status.\n\nI've been to Vegas....a bunch. Sometimes I gamble, sometimes I don't gamble at all. I'm not a big fan of the shows, but I've been to concerts there. I've stayed in shitty hotels and expensive suites. \n\nThe main reason I used to go there is because my local airport only had 3 direct flights and one of them was 100$ to Las Vegas. That's a nice cheap flight to get out of the cold. I was a broke college kid and Vegas could be done cheaply and still can (relative to other major US destinations). \n\nThe main reason I still go once a year or so is because I have a friends group scattered across the country. Vegas is a pretty reliably affordable flight from most major US cities and plenty of smaller ones. The planning is beyond simple. Book rooms and arrive. After that, you can just wing it and people can split up and do their own things and meet up later. You can pick a Michelin-starred joint or grab a drunken hotdog. You can go to a fancy club or sit in a dive bar or just walk around.\n\nYou can shop, catch a show, people watch, go to a sporting event, gamble, drink, eat, every kind of touristy thing, race cars, hot air balloons, shoot machine guns, do drugs, go to strip clubs, chill at pools and any number of other things if you're into them. You can party until the sun comes up or read a book on a hotel balcony and order in.\n\nIt's a bunch of stuff in an area made to be easy to access, that's easy to get to from most of the US, and can accommodate budgets from a few hundred dollars to many millions of dollars all in the same area. \n\nPersonally, it's not a vacation spot for me. It's a good place to meet up with friends for a quick weekend (2-3 nights max). It's not a profound spiritual journey, but it's not meant to be. It's meant to be a playground for adults. Some people aren't going to like that. Some people are going to love it.\n\nEdit: I also see Vegas trashed here *constantly*.",
      "I\u2019m not the biggest fan of Vegas but it\u2019s essentially an adult Disneyland partly due to the fact it\u2019s the only place in the US outside on New Orleans where you can walk around with an alcoholic drink 24/7. \n\nI would never go to Dubai, especially since I\u2019m gay.",
      "At least Vegas isn't owned by religious nuts and doesn't survive on slave labor",
      "The lack of a slave class of Indians is a edge over Dubai and a debatably healthier relationship with women.  Also, if my ex husband is to be believed on that front, in Dubai pretty much \\*everything\\* is expensive, and everyone who isn't virtually enslaved is ridiculously wealthy.  There's a ton that's affordable in Vegas and a ton of people around that are normal people, not people walking a cheetah or getting gold out of an ATM before they go drop 20 bucks on a BK Whopper.\n\nI don't particularly love gambling, particularly as the slots now pretty much just work as reverse ATMs and keep a tally, but if you play blackjack strictly by the book rules and have a fun dealer and fun table, I actually have a great deal of fun with the dynamic, get a lot of free drinks, and with blackjack and low table limits and book rules game play, I'm really not going to be up or down more than about 30 dollars at the end of a day.\n\nThe shows and spectacle and food/drink are what I've liked about it in the past.  I did quite like Fremont St and found it a great place to blend into the background and people watch.  I liked it more a while back when it was more just themed casinos.  I'm not a Disney hater either (except again, recent changes that just are overtly money grubbing) so it had this Epcot sense of instead of Disneyfied countries, it was Disneyfied castles, ancient Egypt, Paris, NYC, etc.  Now it seems like a lot of the casinos are just carbon copy too hip for this world attractions to the limo class, which is probably why I haven't been to Vegas since I got married by an Elvis impersonator to my ex husband.\n\nAnd the shows I've managed to see there, while breathtakingly expensive, were really worth the price of admission.  I had always responded to earlier reports on Cirque with a \"lul why\" when I was younger, but seeing Zumanity (particularly right in the aftermath of the Pulse shooting) was really special.\n\nFor those who don't like the gloss and spectacle, the desert clime there itself is its own thing to see (which it has in common with Dubai, but is a much cheaper flight for Americans) and you can access the Hoover Dam or Grand Canyon without too much effort.\n\nI do fully understand why people wouldn't like it, and it doesn't hold as much appeal for me anymore.",
      "I go to rock climb at red rocks",
      "It\u2019s fun.",
      "I'm from Europe, and I was in Vegas once for about a day and a half when I was around 15. I was too young for gambling, strip clubs, and even drinking, yet I remember it as my favorite city of my entire cross-country roadtrip, with New Orleans being a close second.\n\nIt's an incredibly beautiful city, with so much to see. Looking out the windows as you drive through the city is an experience in and of itself. It's obviously famous for its street lights, gambling, etc., but it's also just a pleasant city overall. Beautiful weather, nice atmosphere, good food, lots of activities, etc. I had a great time even when I was too young to do any of the things you're \"supposed\" to do in Vegas, so I can only assume I would have even more fun as an adult. \n\nIt's a city with a very unique \"personality\". It feels alive, and there's nothing else like it, not in the US, or anywhere else.\n\nThen again, I also like Dubai and Disneyland, so maybe I'm the wrong person to ask.",
      "I think Vegas offers a lot to different types of people for a relatively modest budget. At least that's been my experience going there. Granted it's been a few years so perhaps things have changed. I personally can't stay in Vegas more than 2 days without being ready to go but that's usually not my aim. \n\n1. The obvious gambling\n\n2. Spa's, pampering, food, etc.\n\n3. Various shows.\n\n4. Access to nature outside of the city.\n\n5. International and competitively priced flights from many locations. \n\n6. Affordable car rental. \n\n  \nI've roadtripped from Vegas several times. Once rented a car for a month. It's a good location to start that. Grand Canyon, Red Rock Canyon, All 5 NP's in Utah, Death Valley, Sequoia, etc.",
      "In my early 20s me and my friends loved going clubbing\n\nMight go once a year nowadays for someone\u2019s birthday\n\nAlso from California so it\u2019s less than an hour flight away",
      "I went recently for the first time in a very long time and loved it.  Didn't spend a penny on drinks or gambling (just my preference, no judgement if that's your interest).\n\nWent to two concerts, one of which (Sphere) can't be replicated anywhere else (or until that new Sphere gets built). Saw a Cirque show which is always entertaining. \n\nTook a bunch of cool pics like from the top of the Eiffel Tower and the famous Vegas sign.\n\nSaw the Titanic exhibit which was surprisingly well done.  Went to the Cars of Hollywood of museum which was quaint and fun. \n\nGot to eat at a ton of places I don't have locally. \n\nWindow shopped at the high end stores. Took more pictures of luxury cars they had on display. \n\nSaw the Golden Knights play their home opener which was awesome.\n\nVisited the Shelby Heritage Center which is a must for any American muscle car fan\n\nTook a day trip to see the Hoover Dam. Didn't have time for the Grand Canyon or one of the other beautiful areas nearby. \n\n  \nI would totally go back in a few years to do all the attractions and places to eat I missed.",
      "I love Vegas strip clubs",
      "Las Vegas is insanely fun if you like events. Cirque du soleil, ufc, various musicians who do residency, restaurants, etc.. It\u2019s not all about gambling. It\u2019s all within walking distance.",
      "Double Down Saloon",
      "Once in a while, I like a little gambling, see shows, eat good food, and bit of debauchery with my friends. I do get tired of Vegas after 2-3 days but at least I don\u2019t have to spend a lot of money getting there.\u00a0",
      "You could go to Red Rocks, it's only like 20-30 minutes away and beautiful with tons of great hikes. I'm not a huge fan of Vegas but there's a ratchet quality to it that I enjoy... it's not sanitized. It's not just a tourist destination; people live there. Old Vegas is cool too.",
      "Pretty darn nice hotels can be had for cheap if you time it right, easy to get good food, easy, cheap and plentiful flights, some good shows and it\u2019s right on the doorstep of amazing outdoor activities and some cool areas and towns.  I was just there as a jump off for a road trip; got a suite for like $200, the weather was beautiful, and I spent zero time shopping or in casinos or bars.  I don\u2019t really like Vegas (the strip) either but it is super convenient.",
      "I flew into Vegas last week to go to the Grand Canyon and I could not get out of there fast enough.",
      "As far as I know, bonded indentured  workers are not used for construction in Las Vegas, so there is that as a plus for a start\n\nAlso there is more personal freedom there too, and places to visit nearby (nearby in American terms)",
      "I\u2019ve had a lot of fun there but now that I\u2019m older it\u2019s no longer appealing. I stopped there last night on my way to Utah and it was pretty fuckin\u2019 gross. And overall, I find the casinos depressing.",
      "Leaving for Vegas tomorrow. Big Filipino community there, there\u2019s even a Jollibee. Lots of good food, shows, nature, easy flights\u2026 and plenty of hotels.",

      "I mean, Las Vegas wasn't built with slave labour, so that might have something to do with it.",
      "I like the shows but hate the stench and depression of casinos. The aggressive salesman bug me no end. The heat and the crowds are awful. Don\u2019t even get\nMe started on the traffic.",
      "Disney is a VERY specific type of overpriced and intense. Vegas has a very many number of varied overpriced intense experiences. Disney I want to go once when I was a child and once with future children lol. Vegas I can handle once every 3 years of my adult life for different things.",
      "It\u2019s short and easy to get to from where I live.  There\u2019s things for all ages, shows, professional sports, gambling, shopping, fine dining, everything is walkable on the strip (don\u2019t have to worry about renting a car or figuring out public transit).  There are a variety of hotels from low to high end.  \n\nAnd if you want to do a road trip you have the Grand Canyon, antelope canyons and all the Utah parks on the NE, then heading west you have Death Valley.",
      "I have no problem with Disneyland. It's exactly what it purports to be. An amusement park where you leave reality at the door.  Haven't been since I was a kid, but am very much considering a day or two at Disneyland Paris as a small part of a larger trip next year.\n\nNo desire to go to Vegas or Dubai, though.",
      "There\u2019s more to do in Vegas than drink/gamble/vice. I\u2019m sober but still enjoy going. There are plenty of shows and live events to choose from. The hotels, while gaudy, are some of the most impressive architectural achievements on the planet with equally impressive interiors. You could spend at least a full day just wandering the strip going in & out of each hotel and checking them all out. Great restaurants. Vegas buffets are on another level. \n\nVegas is close. Dubai is on the other side of the world. No matter how you fly\u2026that\u2019s a shitload of travel just to get there. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for nature-type stuff to do then there isn\u2019t much to offer other than desert and Lake Meade. Other than that it\u2019s basically an adult playground. If you went there and were bored then you didn\u2019t try hard enough. \n\nOne major con: it\u2019s expensive\u2026but it goes with the territory. If you\u2019re going to Vegas you should expect to pay a premium\u2026for everything. If you\u2019re going there trying to skimp and save money here and there then you\u2019re probably not going to have as good of a time\u2026but that\u2019s not really why you go to Vegas. If you wanna have a good time somewhere on the cheap, look elsewhere.",
      "I can go to the strip, shopping, upscale dining, the Mojave, the grand canyon, Hoover dam, city that never sleeps, if it just had some ocean...",
      "Dubai is not a bad place to visit. 2 days are enough to see Dubai and Abu Dhabi.\u00a0\n\nDisneyland is an ideal destination for kids. Nothing wrong with going there.\u00a0\n\nVegas is a good place for adults. There\u2019s lot of a shopping, shows and great food in the area.\u00a0",
      "I like Vegas and have no interest in Dubai. \n\nVegas is kitschy and grimy and dirty and completely unapologetic about it. Sure it\u2019s all artificial but it\u2019s also authentic. The Venetian isn\u2019t fake Venice, it\u2019s real Vegas, if you get what I mean. \n\nIt\u2019s also like egalitarian and non-judgmental. It\u2019s where everyone in America goes to just blow off steam. Rich, poor, black, white, whatever, just fuckin get drunk, lose some money at the casino, catch a show, and then nurse a hangover in the pool the next day.\n\nDubai, is like, idk what people do there besides show off that they can go to Dubai. Any friends of mine that go to Vegas show themselves getting drunk, wearing stupid clothes, and like partying and stuff. Every friend of mine that goes to Dubai takes a picture of themselves trying to look rich on a rooftop pool or something.\n\nIdk, maybe it\u2019s just me, but I\u2019m more comfortable down on the street than high in the sky.",

It's on the way to cool places like the Grand Canyon.",
      "I don't like the Las Vegas strip, or any other part of Nevada (ya ya, Tahoe, whatever. I live in the PNW, I look around Tahoe and think \"ok, nice\"). \n\nThe Strip is noisy, too bright, and too many hammered people behaving badly. It has a definite vibe that's not my vibe. \n\nI've also been to Dubai. I don't like that city either. It's hollow and soulless. And honestly, if you're not into power shopping, it's boring and stuffy. \n\nThat being said, if someone from another country asks me where they should go in the USA, I would almost always say, Las Vegas. Why? Because there is nowhere in the world that's like it. It is completely unique, and it feels like no other city, it is interesting,  theres a ton of weird stuff to do. I'd also caveat that by suggesting they visit for no longer than 48 hours. Haha.\n\nI'd be happy if I never went to Vegas ever again. Which sadly probably won't happen. It's one of the few cities in the USA that has enough hotel rooms for massive professional conventions, that returning there, for me, is unavoidable.",

      "I'm not much of a gambler but I enjoy vegas for a long weekend. It's just a critical mass of great shows and great food - which are two of my favorite things. Yeah, you'll pay an arm and a leg for that convenience. But it's definitely a good time.\n\nAll the fake replica stuff and theme'd hotels are fun to check out once. But I never bother with any of it when I go back.\n\nUsually I only plan a trip when I hear of something or someone I really want to see making a stop there. And I never fail to find a billion other stuff to fill the time around it.",
      "Let\u2019s see, amazing dining, shopping, people watching, museums, activities, incredible shows, yeah it\u2019s the worst.",
      "You don\u2019t have to like it.\n\nI enjoy it because I like the occasional super fancy hotel stay, pools, good food and spectacular shows. I also enjoy going to the casinos, but only for a bit. There\u2019s a lot to do there. The entire city bends over backwards to make sure you are constantly entertained.\n\nIt\u2019s a fun place but it\u2019s exhausting. Fun for a weekend.\n\nBut if it\u2019s not your thing it\u2019s not your thing. No big deal.",
      "Good for couple days long weekend for cheap flights / hotels, good shows, dining options, relaxing on the pools, people watching, gambling etc\n\nNot my favorite but I do not hate it either. \n\nAlso you can rent a car and reach many state and national parks if you want",
      "Vegas can be fun. And there's a lot more to do than meets the eye at first glance.\n\nFremont street is great.",
      "Vegas is a free for all. Come as you are, see some wild stuff, gamble and chase riches, find some crazy parties, beautiful people as well as some of the strangest or craziest. Find some luxury or feast on cheap/free drinks at casinos and wander from casino to casino without having to finish your drink first. I haven\u2019t been in over 10 years but have had some awesome times.",
      "Vegas is a great jumping off point for some incredible national parks.  We go at least one a year.  We will fly to Vegas, spend several days at a park, and then go back to Vegas for a few nights.  Always enjoy the amazing restaurants, shows and spas in Vegas.",
      "I go to Vegas almost every summer with the same group of guy friends. We all used to live in the same city and play a low stakes, friendly poker game together. Over the years, most of the group has moved 5 it's the only time we all meet up.\n\nVegas is perfect for us. We rent a giant Airbnb with a pool and BBQ. \n\nWe tend to do the same general things every trip, which include:\n\n- We all play at least one big poker tournament. We go during the World Series of Poker, so that's a major highlight. \n\n- One night out. Usually, we will get dinner and see a show like Cirque or a magic show. Then we go to Freemont Street and walk around, pop into casinos, drink, and gamble.\n\n- One other activity, like hiking, shooting range, museum, or NBA summer league. \n\n- One night where we buy lots of expensive steaks, fancy beer, liquor, cigars, weed, and have a cookout at our Airbnb. \n\nVegas is the perfect for the trip.",
      "The surrounding mountains in Vegas have plenty world class activities",
      "I live about 4.5 hours from Vegas and it's one of two cities closest to where I live (the other being Phoenix) - so it's one of our main options for a quick weekend or getaway.  Vegas has great access to the outdoors (not in summer - but weather is awesome other times of the year for hiking) - we spent the week of Christmas last year in Vegas and had a great time.  Every day we went on a nice hike and had a great meal (we mostly eat off strip - love all the different Asian restaurants). We don't gamble or party hard, but always find plenty to do. Every time we are there I always say \"Vegas is so weird\" and it is not a place I would choose as the year's \"big vacation\" - but we always enjoy it for what it is.",
      "I am ambivalent about Vegas. I\u2019ve been a few times but would be ok if I never go back.",
      "I live in Vegas and tbh the \"strip\" is way too crowded and expensive for me to enjoy as a vacation destination. If you've got the money it's a great place to go crazy. There is some good food options and some good entertainment options but for most people what you typically imagine when you think of las Vegas is simply not for them or our of their price range",
      "Growing up in Los Angeles as a kid and teen my parents would put us all in a van and make the drive the Vegas a couple times a year. They loved it. The only place kids could really stay at and have anything to do was Circus Circus hotel. As a kid I loved the place. All the lights and sounds were exciting to me. But as an adult, can't stand it. I don't gamble, I'm not a big drinker, I was never a big clubber. It doesn't have much to offer me. Many years ago I had a meetup of sorts with a group of friends and we stayed in Vegas with someone who lives there. It was the first time I ever visited Vegas without doing anything related to the Strip or Freemont St. We were in some suburban area and we went to nice restuarants, hookah lounges and went hiking in the Valley of Fire. That was actually the best time I've ever had in Vegas.",
      "I had a great time in Vegas and I don't gamble and don't party.",

      "Love both Dubai and Vegas for different reasons. \u00a0\n\nVegas is an adult Disney land- solid dining, shopping, live shows, I also enjoy walking around the hotels, etc. \u00a0I don\u2019t gamble, so don\u2019t care about that.\n\nDubai, especially away from the tourist areas, has incredible cheap food and great, hospitable people. \u00a0The malls are crazy, I also love the infrastructure and seeing over the top luxury. \u00a0I don\u2019t mind the restrictions, I\u2019m a guest, I follow their cultural norms.\u00a0",

      "Gambling?",
      "Everything you need in a getaway - Luxurious casino resorts and In n Out burgers",
      "Vegas to me is the perfect business gathering/conference location. There\u2019s a ton to see and do in the evenings so you\u2019re not bored between days. You can see a lot of talent doing their art; so many good shows of all kinds. You\u2019re constantly stimulated so you don\u2019t get miserable between days of your conference - since you generally have a ton of down time.",
      "I hate Las Vegas. I just personally don\u2019t get it. The loud slot machines, the people drinking, the \u201cbros\u201d partying\u2014 it all makes me depressed and disappointed about people in general.\n\nBut, yes, of course, to each their own.",
      "I live in Las Vegas. I don\u2019t gamble. I don\u2019t smoke. I don\u2019t work in the gambling industry. The only vice I have is spoiling my two Pekingese. Yet every time I go to the strip, I get a bit excited to see all the pretty lights. Most weeks there is World class entertainment here. It\u2019s never boring. My favorite thing to do on my birthday was to go to the Beatles LOVE show and then go to Bellagio and see the fountains and then in to see the gardens. Don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll be doing this birthday since Beatles LOVE is gone. But the city has a lot of great people who work hard. There\u2019s many other industries here besides the entertainment industry. There\u2019s a lot of families who live here and from all of us to all of you who defended the city, thank you -  from the regular people of Las Vegas. \ud83d\udc9e",
      "Never been to Dubai, but about Las Vegas, if you don't gamble and/or like to eat buffet, there's no reason to go there. As simple as that.",
      "When I was in my 20s: great night life, pool parties, free drinks and entry for ladies (made entertainment very cheap), lots of friendly, like minded people there to have fun\n\nIn my 30s: Great restaurants, shopping, and beautiful hotels",
      "The hiking is amazing over in Utah, also Red Rock Canyon and Mt Charleston. Just beautiful. Then you have the amazing dining and shows there on the strip for when the hike is over.",
      "Hookers and Blow.",
      "I go there for live music. It also has good food. 3 days is my limit.",
      "Listen.  I absolutely cannot *stand* Vegas.  The whole place feels predatory and dark to me.\n\nBut I will also readily admit that Vegas is kinda unique in all the world for what it is, and as such I do think people need to go there at least once to see it.",
      "Relativity is everything. Compared to Dubai sure, compared to conference rooms all over, sure. Compared to an actual resort almost anywhere else. No.",
      "I love it as a business traveler that has gone there a bunch for conventions because it has such a variety of restaurants and if you aren\u2019t in to the gambling part, people watching and eating good food all within a close proximity is fantastic.",
      "Restaurants, shows, clubs, pools, gambling, party people. Vegas is a lot of fun.",
      "I went to Vegas for the first time last year. It was a work trip and I was dreading it, and just assumed it would be the hellish place I\u2019d always pictured. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised. I mean the strip was awful but the people watching was great. And I did a lot of walking in other parts of town, as well as outside it. There were beautiful vistas of mountains, funky cool art stuff, and good food and legal pot everywhere. And the history was cool too. Even the old casinos had this haunting old world vibe. \n\nI think I enjoy a desert paradise (real nature not manufactured). It was unexpected and I\u2019d definitely go back. Not my favorite destination but it exceeded expectations.",
      "It takes 1 hour for me to fly to Nevada and probably 18+ to Dubai. And at least I can get drink in Vegas",

      "I mean, as a non American I feel like there's this funny pop culture influence that really makes me want to visit. Just to see how lame, trashy and bizarre it is. The idea of a city of vice in the middle of a desert is weirdly appealing just to see it and then leave.",
      "I can walk to the airport and take a 40 min flight to Vegas for the day. Eat a fancy dinner, see a show and turn around and come home 24 hours later. It serves a purpose and I love it for that.",
      "Stopped off in Vegas for a few nights on my last National Park road trip.\n\nWas a nice to way to break up a few weeks of camping, eat at some nice restaurants, see some exhibitions, do some shopping and go to a concert. Didn\u2019t a get a chance to get to a Cirque Du Soleil show which was a shame.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got the money and going for a purpose (show, concert, event etc) then it\u2019s a good spot.\n\nDid the same thing Dubai - stopped off a few days to chill out to break up the long haul flight.\n\nWould go to both places again as a stopover to break up a longer trip, but not as a destination.",
      ">What makes it worth visiting in a way Dubai isn't?\n\nThe strip is cooler than anything in Dubai, and there are lots of amazing shows and attractions? Yes it's somewhat tacky but that contrasts with Dubai's... sterility.\n\nQuite frankly I think that people who can't comprehend the appeal of Vegas (or Disneyland or Dubai) must be pretty high on their own farts. If someone came on here and said they didn't understand the appeal of Yellowstone or Yosemite people would roll their eyes at a blatantly contrarian take, and rightfully so.",
      "Vegas is a shitty scam designed to maximally extract money from consumers. At least they spend a little portion of that money on gimmicky themed buildings and fancy lights and fountains to distract you.",
      "I am literally bored out of my mind in Vegas! But I think maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t gamble?? The shows are fantastic though. Been there 2-3x\u2019s and was def ready to leave on the same day.",

      "I think it sucks. Hot AF. Nothing beautiful nature wise. Hyper expensive. Lots of dirtbags. No thanks.",
      "I like Vegas for old downtown (Fremont) and for Red Rocks, Mt. Charleston and for festivals like EDC, Reggae Rise Up and others. The strip is ok, but I\u2019ve done it so damn many times that it doesn\u2019t even register any more. The little china town area around Spring Mountain Rd has some fun stuff too.",
      "Grab a meal in Chinatown, people-watch on the Strip during the day, and soak up the energy of Fremont Street at night.\n\nIf you stick to the usual spots, Vegas can feel touristy. \n\nBut if you know what you\u2019re looking for and actually spend time doing the research (gasp), you\u2019ll find places that truly deserve their merit. \n\nThere is always something new to try, no matter how many times you visit.",
      "Vegas can be whatever you want it to be. \n\nYou want a vacation where you drink and gamble, easy. You want a fancy dinner with a show, done. You want to shop all day, no problem. You want to sit by the pool, there\u2019s that too. You want do to excursions all day, it\u2019s all there. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to go back and not do the same things. I\u2019ve been a few times both for work and fun. It\u2019s an easy get away.",
      "I loved Omega Mart and Area15, the food is good once you leave the strip, the shows are super cool and entertaining, the architecture and the lights are stunning, and the street performers are talented.  I also really LOVE people-watching - whether they\u2019re too high/drunk or they\u2019re going through a bad gambling bender lol.",
      "I don't like Las Vegas for Las Vegas.  I like Las Vegas as a jumping off point to do other things that happen to be relatively near it.  There's a lot of natural attractions in an 8 hour driving range.  It's an easy city to get to, the airport is logically laid out and easy to navigate, rental cars are cheap-ish, etc.  I'll see  a show, eat at one of the restaurants, and then leave to do other stuff.\n\nI can't imagine spending more than 1-2 days there at a go and not even that during peak times.",
      "I know this is shocking to people on Reddit, but *different people like different things*.",
      "I like going there to chill and do guy stuff. \n\nI generally, sleep late, go to the pool during the day, then have a nice dinner, theres lots of great food in vegas. Then i usually go watch some sports and place some minor bets while drinking for free and smoking a big cigar.\n\nSometimes ill then go hit a craps table for an hour to two and go to bed. Occasionally ill catch a show if i like whats in town. \n\nRarely spend more than 1500 bucks for 4 days, and just chill the whole time. Its not a destination vacation for me, its a \"get out of town\" for a few days and reset type of thing. Sometimes my wife comes and sometimes she doesnt.",
      "The hotel rooms are nice and The Sphere is fun.",
      "It\u2019s better than spending 1K just to spend majority of it falling in line in Disneyland, for 3-4 1minute rides.

      "If you go to Vegas and your entire time is spent on the strip, you're doing it wrong.\n\nVegas has some of the best food options in the world, but off strip. \n\nAlso, red rock is nice, valley of fire is also great. \n\nJust avoid Vegas between May and October.",
      "I've not been there s much as most regulars, only like 6 times.\n\nBut let me give you my take. \n\nWhat's great about Vegas? \n\nLas Vegas is a place you can fly into for 2-4 days and be your absolute worst version of yourself. And here's the kicker- it's fine. \n\nEveryone there is doing the same thing. \n\nYou a gambler? Get off on the rush of big wins or losses? This is your Mecca. \n\nGambling doesn't do it for you? How about gluttony? Any food you want in the world, they have it, and in spades (ha). Buffets, sushi, brunch, steaks, seafood in the middle of the desert!!.\n\nOk fine, no gambling and you're not an eater...how about sloth? You can get a hotel with poolside service all day. Kids annoy you? Adult only pool area. Boom. Do nothing but bask in the lovely April desert sun for 4 days...Vegas is happy to have you. \n\nCulture? Ok-how about dozens of the biggest names you grew up with doing shows and residencies? It's Brittany, bitch...\n\nWanna cosplay Hunter Thomson? Go for it. Booze is cheap and easy. The streets are full of people hocking a DARE officer's worst nightmare...pick your poison (responsibly) \n\nAnd the list goes on. Sex, clubs, guns, spas, shopping, all of it!! \n\nVegas is a an international, blow-off-steam, amusement park of a city. \n\nGo there, be your worst self,  tip your service staff well, and revel in the fact that everyone's being bad. \n\nThen leave, go be a real human succumb to the drudgery and responsibilities of society. \n\nCome back again in 6 months to a year to let that pressure valve go again.",
      "I've been to Vegas twice, both times for a work convention, but I flew in the Friday before so I had the weekend to explore. \n\nThe first time I drove out to Red Rocks, saw the Michael Jackson Cirque du Soleil show (fantastic), and checked out the lobbies of some hotels (Bellagio is very impressive with the Chihuly glass and indoor garden). I don't really gamble, but I do drink, so I sat in Paris - live the decor - and played the penny slots and have a few free drinks. The second time I drove out to the Hoover Dam. I would have loved to see more shows and eat at celebrity restaurants, but my budget didn't allow it.\n\nIt's not somewhere I'd choose to go again, but if the opportunity arose - a work trip or getaway with friends - I wouldn't say no.",
      "All of the sinful fun stuff you can do in Vegas is illegal in Dubai.",
      "Definitely worth visiting once. Even if it's not your 'thing', you owe it to yourself to experience it and see what it's all about. You can 'participate' or just go and observe. Regardless it is worth doing on e.",
      "Vegas\u2026.armpit of the nation!",
      "I actually found it a bit depressing filled with loads of people who didn't look like they had money to lose sitting at all hours in the dark, losing money.\n\nWe were staying at the Belagio, pretty smart hotel too, sort of sureal looking at the Disneyland architecture with these incredible mountains in the background, but I just couldn't bring myself to want to bet, it just didn't look enjoyable, I don't know what I was expecting, maybe Robert de Niro & Joe Pecci or the rat pack ?\n\nGift from the Mrs, helicopter ride to the base of the Grand Canon made up for it...breathtakingly spectacular out over the desert & the Hoover Dam at dawn.\n\nSounds cheesy, but the helicopter pilot knew his stuff, he flew over the lip of the Canyon to the sound of 2001 space odyssey & flying within the canyon prior to landing was a memory of a lifetime",
      "Vegas has a lot for different people. Gambling. Great clubs. Very good dining. A wide range of interesting shows. Outstanding conference & event facilities.\n\nIf none of those appeal to you, no problem. I haven't been for 12 years, I'm happy with that, and it's not on my list to visit any time soon. Some people go annually or more, if they enjoy it, great.",

Honestly\u2026",
      "I like it because of the 24/7 dispensary right off the strip; Reef dispensary.  The times I\u2019ve been to Vegas, I\u2019ve usually been on a work related trip so I get to enjoy amenities rather than pay for them.  It\u2019s only been one time I was there and didn\u2019t have some sort of 3-4 day gig and that was the first time I ever went with an ex girlfriend.  To be fair, back then, I really didn\u2019t think much of it but I didn\u2019t really spend too much time there either.\n\nMost times I\u2019m there I really just get to walk around and smoke.  It\u2019s relaxing in a way and I enjoy seeing everyone moving around.  I was actually there just the end of last month and thought to myself why I enjoy it so much.  I don\u2019t gamble, barely drink, yeah I smoke weed but that\u2019s about it.  However, I\u2019m really a fan of being able to walk around places with people, doing my thing vining out and Vegas has that.",

So overall it\u2019s a great consolidated location many activities for many different types of people.",

If you want to have endless options to hike within 30 minutes to 3-4 hours, Vegas is the spot.\n\nLake Mead, Mount Charleston, and Red Rock Canyon are all within 30-45 minutes away, and it would take years of weekend wanderings to even get the gist of any one of those crossed off by hiking them.\n\nThere are ghost towns to explore, 4X4 trails to drive, rock walls to climb, tons of federal land to just drop a tent down and camp where you'd like, Lake Mead and the Colorado River for water stuff, tons of Utah, California, and Arizona state and national parks within an afternoon's drive, on and on and on.\n\nI've heard the city has some decent entertainment and food options as well.",

Dubai when I was there, I would not see people unless I\u2019m INSIDE a mall/hotel or INSIDE an attraction.\n\nVegas landmarks don\u2019t give off a pretentious vibe. You know they are built to be rip offs and fake and they don\u2019t pretend to be otherwise.\n\nDubai\u2019s landmarks are all built to be the tallest of this, the only 7 star of this, the biggest of this. But they are nothing but shells of bricks and concretes with no history or culture behind them. They are just as fake and rip off, but give off that pretentious vibe of being better than everyone else.\nAnd then you see the VERY apparent divide between the ultra wealthy and ultra poor of middle easterners vs south Asians, makes it feel like even more of a city of just the wealthiest being overloaded with money with nowhere else to spend but use to show off to you. Made me kind of want to throw up.\n\nVegas I went 3x, knew what I was getting into and had amazing time.\nDubai I went 1x with this expectation of an amazing city from all the travel ad campaigns by them, I never ever want to go back.

Check. \n\nWant to be a degenerate gambler? Check. \n\nWant to see some great shows/concerts? Check. \n\nWant to get away and relax for a few spa days? Check. \n\nWant to play some great golf at fantastic courses? Check. \n\nWant to get housed and at some of the top clubs? Check. \n\nWant to get sexy at a myriad of diff pool parties? Check. \n\nLonely and want to legally pay for sexual favors? Check.

Every time I go there I realize how big of a tourist trap it is.Yes maybe losing a lot of money influences this decision. But on another level with the amount of money you spend there I think there are 1000 other trips that you could spend half the money on and have twice as good of an experience.

      "This is true. I went to Vegas my first time when I was 27 for a friend\u2019s bachelor party. It was super fun but a wild and exhausting 48 hours or so. \n\nTrips 2 and 3 for both for the same annual conference in Nov 2023 and Oct 2024. Will be going again in Jun 2025 for a different conference and likely fall 2025 for the conference I\u2019ve just done 2x.\n\nThe conference I just didn\u2019t years in a row was always in San Jose CA pre pandemic but when it resumed in 2022 it moved to Vegas which is a million times better for a conference than San Jose. I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s better than most cities for conferences and has far more reasonable rates better properties and so much to do.\n\nAs an almost 40 year old with way more income to spend than my first trip, Vegas is even more fun now. Especially since not going to just party.",
      "I've been there three times this year for work conferences. I don't mind it, but I don't gamble or drink, so I'd never go there by choice. It's certainly a place that I think people should see once in their life.",
      "They do run out of hotel rooms sometimes, for all intents and purposes. Last time I had to stay there for one night, there was one room left 20-30 miles south of Vegas, and it was like $300+. There *were* some rooms in the city, but they were thousands of dollars, some of them even for $10k+. All the off-strip places in Vegas/Henderson/etc. were sold out. At least the Ubers were pretty reasonable.\n\nAnyway, there are a decent number of events and concerts there. I might rather fly into Vegas, *usually* have cheaper transportation/lodging, usually be less crowded than, say, flying into LA (if the event/concert is a tour). Breeze also connects directly to Vegas from some east coast cities, you can sometimes get a one-way for like $70.\n\nI'd also say, a couple of the hotels on strip I've stayed at have been fantastic, much better than hotels I've been at in most cities. Free parking (presumably because they want you to gamble even if you're not staying, though parking can fill up on the weekends), rooms themselves are super quiet even though it's a party downstairs, and tons of restaurants without having to get in a car to go anywhere, can walk to events at other hotels on the strip, and they often have the rooms ready several hours early if you arrive early.",
      "Yup, and the complaints are always, \"It's so fake and tacky!\" Yeaaaaah....that's not some great revelation. It's actually kind of the point. No one is going to Vegas expecting to see the real Eiffel Tower or Venitian canals. If fake and tacky aren't your things, fine, but people need to stop thinking they're some kind of cultural connoisseur for pointing it out repeatedly.",

      "I was never interested in Vegas.  I grew up up in a small town in the rural midwest in the 1980s.  And the ladies I worked with (as a teenager) at the local grocery store would save for YEARS (5-10 or more), really keeping a tight budget to squirrel away every penny all to go to Vegas and PRETEND to be rich for a few days and blow it all gambling. These families never saved for retirement, had no plan if they ever had to stop working. It was just frankly sad.  My mom taught me to enjoy today- but plan for tomorrow too.  If those ladies and their families had put that money in the stock market?  They would have retired in the early 2000s with millions. \n\nAnd I went to Vegas for a conference in my undergrad years... I have a few memories:\n\n\\- GROSS buffet\n\n\\- SMELLY, loud, gambling rooms\n\n\\- Coupons handed out on the street for prostitutes. \n\nMany years later, I had to go to a professional meeting at one of the nicest hotels on the strip...and I watched a gross man smoke a gross cigar inside, next to a 10K+ Christian Dior silk gown.  And I just could not. I would never buy such a dress. But to stink it up and ruin it with gross cigar smoke?\n\nI never understood gambling as entertainment though.  It does not compute. So YMMV.",

      "Reddit is obviously a reactionary place, but the human rights stuff isn't overboard in this case. They recruit  migrant workers from impoverished areas around the world with promises of high wages. The workers often sign a loan deal with the recruiters for several thousand dollars at 10%+ interest to cover airfare and visa costs. The recruiters then sell their laborers to construction companies. When they get there they find out they're making 100$ a month to work construction in the desert. Often times their passports are seized and multiple months of pay are held on the promise that if they keep working they'll eventually get the back pay. \n\nGo check out a video of the labor camps they're housed in. Multiple human rights groups agree on between 20-25,000 migrant workers dying a year due to living and working conditions in the rich Gulf states (UAE, SA, Qatar)."

      "I\u2019m currently cycling around the world and this past winter I spent two months cycling in Oman \ud83c\uddf4\ud83c\uddf2, a.k.a. the hidden gem of the Middle East, a country which surprised me with its natural diversity, laidback way of life & hospitality. I wanted to share some pics & thoughts.\n\nAs soon as entered Oman from the UAE, I took a turn onto a small road heading into the Hajar Mountains. I was rewarded with a rugged but beautiful mountainous landscape, and butter-smooth yet empty roads. This part of the country is sparsely populated, and you will come across many more goats than humans. Despite this there are frequent drinking water dispensers on the side of the road, often even cooled!\n\nIf you are looking for a challenge, search for unpaved roads or paths on your maps, as these usually lead through Wadis, which are dry river beds, resulting in short, but unimaginably steep ascents, often reaching inclines of 30%. This meant a lot of bike-pushing, which even in winter is exhausting as temperatures were still hovering around 30C.\n\nVillages are sparse but very scenic, and also felt quite conservative, often the only people speaking English were migrants, mostly from Pakistan or Bangladesh. One afternoon a Pakistani family invited me for dinner and to spend at their place, and even offered to slaughter a goat for me, which I declined.\n\nAs I continued my way south and left the steep Wadi roads behind, I came across the first foreign tourists, most of them visiting the historic cities of Al Hamra and Nizwa, famous for its forts and date plantations. Here you will also find the Jebel Shams, with just over 3000m the highest mountain on the Arabian peninsula. I took a short break to rest and to do some hiking.\n\nI then made my way towards the capital of Oman, Muscat, mainly to replace my broken camping stove. Apparently there are some nice beaches around Muscat, but I only spent a day here as I cycling in cities designed for cars will never be fun to cycle in (looking at you, Dubai!). However, Muscat marked the starting point for the long journey towards Salalah, Oman\u2019s third biggest city, and the only major one in the south, close to Yemen. The distance via the highway is about 1000km, however it crosses Oman in the centre, which is mostly a massive wasteland, with few resupply points.\n\nInstead I wanted to cycle ~1300km along the coast, where I would pass through some small cities and fishing villages, and the landscape would be a bit more interesting. Or so I thought.\n\nShortly after I reached the North-Eastern tip of Oman and started heading south, the landscape became extremely monotonous. Most of the time the road was actually a few kilometres inland, so I couldn\u2019t quickly hop into the ocean to cool down or relax at the beach. I was surrounded by a empty, flat land with nothing more than a few bushes and the occasional camel for the next two weeks. That was longer than planned for this stretch, reason being that during the first week I was facing strong headwinds making the ride even more challenging, physically and mentally. Fortunately two fellow German bicycle travellers were also in the region, so we met up and made the boring ride a bit more entertaining.\n\nAfter a few days together we parted ways and I slowly started to appreciate the solitude, reason being the lack of cars, silence, clear night skies and the fact that the headwind was gone. I started making process and soon reached the mountains of the Dhofar governorate, of which Salalah is the capital. A spectacular scenery can be found in this region, with pristine beaches on the left, steep mountains on the right, and scenic Wadis in between. In summer it is supposedly even more picturesque, when the entire landscape is green and full of life thanks to tropical storms (\u2018Khareef\u2019) bringing in lots of rain. Temperatures will also drop below 30C, making it arguably the only place in Oman where one could cycle during summer, when temperatures in rest of the region reach 40+ degrees Celsius.\n\nAnd just like that I had made it - cycling almost the entire length of Oman. Continuing further south into Yemen wouldn\u2019t have been wise, so I flew to Kyrgyzstan to continue my journey around the globe.\n\nLooking back, Oman is definitely among my favourite countries I\u2019ve been to. You will be surprised by its diverse landscape and warmly welcomed by the Omanis and migrant workers alike. Cities are modern, there are many cheap restaurants and free drinking water can be found at mosques. It\u2019s also one of the safest countries in the world, making it an option for solo female travellers. On that note, I was surprised how few local women I\u2019ve come across during my two months here. Oman is quite a bit more conservative than the Emirates for example in that regard. On the flip side, this means that you will find beautiful traditional architecture  instead of skyscrapers.\n\nThanks for reading, you might be interested in the posts I shared cycling across [Iran](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/s/f8eYro9miN) and [Mongolia](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/s/MAycJ4BGjd).",

      "O- man, what a great trip. lol",
      "Incredible stuff. Thanks for sharing your journey! Safe travels",
      "Amazing u/MaxRoving! I often fantasize of such adventures. Question: how did you deal with sicknesses? Were you camping outside daily? What about threats from local wild animals? Any incidents?",
      "Reminds me of Egypt... Did you go there also? \n\nI had an amazing time there and never felt a bit unsafe, despite traveling there on my own. Wasn't cycling, though. \ud83d\ude02",
      "Yes!!!! Where the fishies give you the pedicure? \ud83d\ude01\u2764\ufe0f\n\nDid you go to Wadi Shaab?",

      "Maybe around $700",
      "I just created one (link on my profile) as many people have suggested it, I\u2019m gonna record my journey in Vietnam where I\u2019ll arrive in a week and if I like the outcome I\u2019ll share it \ud83d\ude05",

      "You don't see women in pics because in this region, it's disrespectful to take photos of women without their permission. And if you do ask for permission, most of them will say no. When you go to Oman, you actually see a lot of women. At the cafes, restaurants, parks, markets. But walking around in remote areas, no, you don't see many women there. If you do see any humans in remote areas, it's usually a worker or some guy looking for a goat. \n\nAnd as a female tourist, it's totally fine. Super safe, and no one will take pictures of you haha.",
      "Oman is considered the fifth safest country globally! Quite safe for women. In my experience, everyone is very respectful. You won\u2019t see women in photos generally bc 1) they are probably hanging out at home and 2) Middle East has a strong culture regarding privacy. Most women don\u2019t want their photo taken, especially by a foreigner to post online.",
      "It\u2019s kind of weird how instinctively racist and full of assumptions everyone here becomes as soon as someone posts about an Arab country.",
      "Why do you all need to see women in photos all the time? Confused by this.",
      "They have freedom. What freedoms do you think they don't have? In addition to western freedoms, they also don't have to worry as much about rape if they go out to clubs as we do in the west. \n\nI have been there multiple times as a solo woman, and it's fine.",

      "Why wouldn\u2019t it have occurred to you\u2026?",
      "There is  basically no crime in Oman. One of the safest and most friendly countries in te world",
      "Holy fuck. I can\u2019t believe people like you still exist. Straight out of the 90s with the assumptions. I thought this sub would be filled with people who have ACTUALLY traveled, and not just to Paris and London. Jesus Christ."

We went to Disney which is freaking expensive and not really a vacation I want to play by ear since having a schedule to cram everything in is essential. They were not considerate of being on time and were consistently late/wanted to take hours long lunch breaks even though we were behind schedule. So unless you know your friends can follow a schedule, be considerate, and have a similar budget, I advise against it.",

I\u2019m not saying that one is better than the other, but having travel styles in common is super important. I also have different people in my life for different types of travel. My friends are great at super relaxed all inclusives, while my partner thrives at adventure vacations. I pick the right person for the right vacation!",

What to do if:\n\n\\-- Someone is a night owl and someone is an early bird  \n\\-- There are money differences  \n\\-- There are interest differences  \n\\-- VERY IMPORTANT - you do not have to be attached at the hip 24/7. Hours, or even a whole day alone on a group trip is fine. It gets everyone out of each other's hair, pursue the things they individually like, etc.\n\nAs someone else said, it can be really good or really bad. Back in the 90s, I went to Europe with 3 other people. One, I eventually married. One was our best man. And the third one? I stopped talking to them halfway through the trip.",

Every day my friend would say I want to do this and the other girl would say ok. She thought everything was fine until the other girl sat down and cried publicly because she didn\u2019t get to do anything she wanted to, which she never expressed. So I\u2019ve always had the rule that I only want to travel with people with opinions who speak for themselves and will do their own planning. I\u2019m perfectly happy to spend the day by myself and meet up with a travel buddy for dinner or just see them at our lodging and I need someone just as independent. Still traveling solo.",

In your case, for instance, I\u2019d have said \u201clet\u2019s meet for lunch at x\u201d and also \u201cdo y together,\u201d and made that happen. Then you can do things your way and I can do things mine.\n\nOn extended family/friends vacations the usual mo is a few joint activities, plus some \u201cwe\u2019re doing x; join if you want\u201d stuff, and then all meet back up at the ranch for drinks before dinner. Depending on the locale, we\u2019ll take turns making dinner or go out.\n\nHonestly, your problem isn\u2019t traveling with friends; it\u2019s failing to plan ahead for different travel styles.",
      "Yeah sorry I would also never go on vacation with you. I do not \u201efollow a schedule\u201c on my free time and I sure as hell take as long breaks as I want ON MY VACATION. Maybe you are just not compatible.",

      "Don't force your friends to do things you like.  \nWhen we travel - each of us design their actions and we meet during lunch or places that we all want to see. And then at the evening we exchange our experience.  \n\nThis way you both keep your sanity and friendship.",

Ive travelled several times with friends internationally, including one trip which was 4 months long.\n\nWhen we were on different schedules, wanted different meals, wanted to see different things, we'd just say I'm gonna do this, enjoy your thing and I'll see you later. \n\nNever had a problem.",
      "You\u2019re a person that needs structure on vacation. It\u2019s not a bad thing, it\u2019s just how you prefer to vacation. Your friends go with the flow. This is clearly not a match when it comes to travel. You need to vet your friends before you agree to a vacation. I go on vacation with friends, and we\u2019re all casual with loose itineraries. It works out well for us. We also have an agreement where the hotel or house we rented is home base. We agree to meet for meals and all kind of go our separate ways during the day. This way if I don\u2019t feel like something is interesting I can go off and do my own thing without upsetting someone.",
      "Oof. Maybe they were just worried about offending you and had a more relaxed approach to the vacation, but if they agreed to the schedule, they should stick to the schedule. Or at least let you know in advance that they would be doing their own thing. \n\nI traveled with my best friend and it profoundly irritated me how she couldn't do anything on her own. If I didn't want to do something it was taken very personally, so I found myself being dragged along to things I specifically said I didn't want to do. She invited her on-and-off again boyfriend at the last minute and wanted us all to share a room to save money... when I had specifically stated that I need my own space. It was like she couldn't respect the words coming out of my mouth and instead was trying to impose her wants onto me. \n\nI would much rather be alone than deal with all that.",

One that\u2019s intended to be fun and relaxed, and one that\u2019s scheduled like a middle school with exactly 4 minutes to get from A to B.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to travel with friends, you need to have clear expectations around what type of trip this is going to be, and no pressure if the other party wants to bow out of some of the things because of the schedule.",
      "I think it comes to different styles. People who have rigid schedules on a vacation are the worst.  They can\u2019t just decompress and enjoy the moment.  It just adds stress when the goal of a vacation is to de-stress.  having travelled extensively, there are 20 things a day that can throw off a schedule, you just have to adapt and move forward.",

      "I've traveled extensively with friends.  Flexibility, patience, and humor are key.  I NEVER would go with a scheduler. To me, roaming, exploring, unplanned stops and side trips, make the trip.",
      "I have friends that are extreme planners for trips. They tend to need to control the entire schedule without really offering their travel companions to speak their mind on how they want their trip to go. Did you ask them what they wanted to do for scheduling, or did you plan it all and then ask them if all was okay? Some friends say yes because they know you won\u2019t pivot plans to their wants either way. \n\nI like to plan as well but on a more broad basis and not a \u201cfirm time here\u201d and \u201c this is too expensive to not do everything on my list or it\u2019s not worth the cost\u201d. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t ask for any of their input in the planning part I think that you should start. Everyone\u2019s time and opinions should be respected. Especially if kids are involved and firm scheduling other peoples kids is a hard no from me.",
      "Meanwhile, in a different post, they are bitching about how you had everything scheduled to the minute and couldn't take a break to relax and enjoy things.\n\nYou need to understand that different people have different priorities, motives, and styles when it comes to vacations/holidays.\n\nYou sound like the type who wants to have an idea of everything that's going to happen. And be very well planned.  That's great if it works for you.  It doesn't work for everyone.  \n\nI personally don't like that type of trip.  One problem is that if you encounter any sort of unexpected delay, It causes a lot of stress.  You need to build in extra time in the day for uncertainty.\n\nSome people have very stressful lives and want to do the exact opposite in their travel.  They want to have downtime.  They want to relax and see & do things at their own pace.  My wife is like that.\n\nMy mother is the other extreme, She's like you and wants every second of every day planned.  I'm somewhere in the middle.  I like to have a few things planned for the day but also be flexible enough to enjoy a stress free day and have time to work around unforeseen obstacles.\n\nThe point is that different people have different styles, and now you know that your friends styles of travel do not sync up with yours.  That's fine.  \n\nThey can still be your friends, Just don't travel with them anymore.  Or if you do, understand where they're coming from and make separate arrangements.",
      "Sucks that you had a bad experience! I\u2019ve been there before and it\u2019s miserable especially if you\u2019re the one who is the planner and trying keep everyone on schedule if there\u2019s a hard schedule you need to follow.\n\nNeed to be on the same page with people that you travel with. I have friends that are great travel companions and I have friends I would never dream of traveling with. Have to be upfront with people and set expectations about the trip to make sure you are all ok with the itinerary.",

Some of my best memories in life are from traveling with my best friends.\n\nYou just gotta have similar expectations, and also be somewhat independent. I\u2019m perfectly fine if my friends wanna go shopping and I wanna go do something else, see you at dinner!",
      "People have such different ideas and expectations when traveling together.\n\nSome people are schedule-driven, some are go with the flow.  So you had a mismatch there.  If that happens again, you can split up during the day, and all eat dinner together later.\n\nI've had this issue with extended family vacations.  Everyone is much happier when they can do things their way,\n\nSometimes people take togetherness a bit too far.  You can still enjoy traveling together, but not doing it all together.",

      "Did they wanted to follow a schedule??",
      "It depends. I travel with a group of 7 all the time. It's three couples, and a single. Our rule is that we try to do one thing together each day, usually in the morning. Then after that, all bets are off. Myself and one of the married guys like to take off and do history stuff, my spouse, for a dude, loves shopping. So he peals off with the wife of the guy I'm out at some weird museum with, and our single gal pal. The other couple kind of stick together and do their thing. Usually visiting  weird record stores or doing something that might be less physically taxing than what the rest of us might be doing. \n\nVery often, we might all stick together, other times, we might all peal off individually. We will often regroup in the evening and go to dinner together or meet for cocktail hour. \n\nYou just haven't found the right group of travel friends.",

I'm probably a bit of an asshole because I book affordable accommodations that aren't fancy because my view is I'm generally only there for 8-ish hours to sleep and shower, etc. She also criticizes that I travel with a large backpack instead of a suitcase. I was done travelling with her after she started commenting about my luggage. Who the hell cares what luggage I use?",
      "did you talk to them about expectations before you left? did you talk to them about how they like to travel? did you all agree upon on the schedule? when they started to fail the schedule did you confront them about it and adjust?\n\ntraveling with friends is amazing, you just need to communicate travel styles before you leave. personally id hate having your tight schedule. having time limits on lunch? sometimes shit pops up and it\u2019s totally unrealistic to follow a schedule, sounds not fun at all if you\u2019re just rushing through. personally i like to set two or three goals of things to do each day and if you wanna spend extra time for lunch or dinner that\u2019s ok. \n\nyou sound like you\u2019re micromanaging your friends too much. next time when lunch goes over how about just enjoying your friends company and telling yourself next time youre at disney you\u2019ll do those things, or even better why are you so insistent on doing these things w your friends? you can go solo. you cant force your friends to do the things you want to do",
      "did you discuss the schedule before traveling or did you just make it up in your head and expect people to go along with it?\n\nsome people view a vacation as a relaxing time where you dont have to plan anything or do anything.  it sounds like that is not you, but you expected your group to also be like that.\n\nI would also love to find the reddit post from your friends about your clipboard of fun",

But people who want to chill and relax wouldn't be great to bring on a hectic Disney trip if you're trying to do everything.\n\nOn the other hand, a hyper scheduler would be a nightmare to bring on a resort holiday where you're planning on just eating, drinking, lying by the beach and swimming.",

      "The thing that everyone has to realize on a trip like that is that traveling together doesn't mean you have to do everything together. If you want to stick to a schedule and they want to relax, that's fine. Split up and do your thing and they can do their thing.",

So, may be chill out a bit?! Not everyone is going to be match the frequency you are in. Especially when it\u2019s a larger group.\n\nThe point is while I understand what you\u2019re saying, it is important that frequencies match. Some people like to be on schedule, some people are more laid back and thus it\u2019s important when you\u2019re running on tight schedule. But if they\u2019re your friends, and the inconvenience isn\u2019t that too much, may be find a middle ground and just enjoy the time out with your friends. Does it really matter if you miss out on a few rides/experiences out of the hundreds that you planned to do?! Don\u2019t get me wrong, I am most certainly like you who likes to have a plan and stick to it. But something that I\u2019ve learnt from my experiences, is that when you go on trips, specially if it\u2019s something like Universal or Disney, things deviate due to N number of reasons and you just have to deal with it. Why do you have to stress about it! \n\nBut for future trips, now you know whom to go with. Some people might still make the cut! Haha.",

Your friends are probably saying never travel with someone (you) who is so square with zero adaptability.",
      "I wouldn't say the most important thing is whether or not your friends can follow a schedule but rather that you're all on the same wavelength on that trip. Sometimes I'm feeling a spontaneous trip and don't mind travelling with people who are quite lax but other times I do want to be more regimented and have a more rigid itinerary. As long as we're in agreement about the type of trip we're doing then it's fine. Also, sometimes we split up and rendezvous once people have done what they want to do if we cant agree which is also fine!",

      "Sometimes when traveling with \u201cfriends,\u201d you find out who they really are. Bill Murray once said, \u201cIf you have someone you think is the one, take them and travel around the world. Buy a plane ticket for the two of you to travel all over the world, to places that are hard to reach and hard to get out of. And when you land at JFK and you\u2019re still in love with that person, get married\u201d. This is an extreme example, but I feel it can apply to friendships, too. Some folks are good at hiding their true nature when most things are copacetic. Small differences like scheduling aside, you can find out who someone truly is under the stress of being in a foreign country, how they treat people who are different from them, how they treat you in unfamiliar environments. Speaking from a few experiences.",
      "Yeah, I think the important lesson is to make sure friends are compatible for travel. Not every friendship has to be travel-buddy. \n\nWe like to have a schedule but we have friends who feel like \u201cI am on vacation and I won\u2019t be rushed). If we travel together (not often) we make sure that our plans are independent - if they want to take 3 hours for breakfast, good for them, but we\u2019ll be off doing something.",
      "I just did Disney earlier this year with my friends. I made sure everything everyone wanted to do was on the schedule with a couple of rest days. I told them, I don't care what they do, but don't complain to me if they miss something. Everyone had a blast and got to do the things they wanted to. Just making sure. Everyone understands the schedule, including the scheduler, helps a lot.",
      "Conversation ahead of time is the key here\n\nI spent a week with a buddy and within the first couple hours I wanted to kill myself",
      "I went to the Philippines with 5 other friends for just over 4 weeks. Was fantastic. A few quams but nothing major. We'd split up sometimes and all had local sim cards so we could communicate. We only had right schedules when we would book a boat for a few days or scuba or swim with whale sharks etc. My Philippino friend planned pretty well everything and having a \"local\" helps so much. \n\nHopefully your next experience isn't so bad. I traveled a lot and have a few days booked only then find things to do once we would talk to locals and other tourists. Some of the best trips are ones with minimal planning.",
      "Yeah, it depends. I had trips where I had a great time and trips where I had a bad time. I think the worst is traveling with just one friend. I had a Cambodia/Thailand trip with one of my beat friends and I didn't really enjoy it. At one point we just did our separate thing.",
      "Idk I\u2019ve traveled with friends and it was fantastic. We wanted to do most of the same things but if we wanted to do different things or one of us just wanted to chill at the lodging, we went our separate ways for the day.",

      "We have friends who the wife is  always hint at joining us on a vacation. I changed the subject all the time as I know we would not make good travel partners. We travel a lot, they don\u2019t and based on stories they have told us of travel with other friends, they have to be hand fed all the plans and booking info. Also when they don\u2019t like said plans they get moody and grumpy. They also won\u2019t make plans of their own and want to do everything together.  I finally told her I value her friendship too much to ruin it by going on a vacation with them.  She was a bit put out at first but then I think she realized the sentiment sincere.",
      "We do group trips every other year. I'm from the USA but live in Australia, and some our friends are now mutual as they met at our wedding in Hawaii and really hit it off, so we know who gets along well. \n\n  \nWe have a good sense of the financial \"comfort\" of our friends (house, car, travel and dining habits), and how they behave when things like the dinner check comes, etc (do they forensically split it up, or simple even split). So based on that, we have a feel for who can afford what. We've done this in Hawaii, Costa Rica, Thailand, Mexico, Bali. \n\nWhen we come up with a trip, we usually start with floating a concept, see who's in, and set a budget. Example: \"Thailand, Private Villa, 10 days, November, $300pp/day + your flights and transport, who's in?\" I usually include a couple of potential villas or resorts. Villas with private chefs work well to address dining restrictions, allergies, kids, etc. \n\nWe are leaving soon on a one-month holiday, finsihing in Cancun with some of our USA friends. We have some solid plans, which include dinner each night, and shuttles (airport, fun parks, shopping, etc.). Our friends know if they want to go with us to those things, then thats the time, if they want to do their own thing, cool. Everything else is just \"relax\". This works well for resorts and villas.\n\nI would never do a group trip to Disney or anything like that.\n\nIf you find yourself waiting on your friends when you're home, if you get frustrated with them over splitting checks, etc. They probably arent travel friend material.",
      "You do understand that you have free will to do whatever you want, right?",
      "Sorry your vacation wasn\u2019t what you were hoping for. This is definitely the biggest perk of traveling alone. There\u2019s no \u201cwrong\u201d way to do vacations, but there are definitely wrong people to vacation with. If your general styles (structured or not structured) don\u2019t align, you\u2019re in trouble. But even if you\u2019re aligned there, you need to be interested in the same activities, etc. or all be willing to split up as needed so everyone can get what they want from the trip. Hope the next one is better for you!",
      "I love travelling with friends, and you all really need to be on the same page with how you want your days to go. Whether it is committing to a schedule, or being more loose, everyone should be on the same page to make it work.",
      "I\u2019ve traveled with family, friends, and SOs, and traveling alone will always beat them. You\u2019re on your schedule and terms. I know it\u2019s not for everyone and that\u2019s okay but if you\u2019ve never tried it I recommend it.",
      "Traveling with multiple people, even family and good friends, add more challenges and drama.\n\nI find this be true for any trip longer than a weekend.",
      "You have to have the same travel style for it to work",
      "depends on if you are not such a huge group, i can bet that\u2019s too chaotic and somebody will always be running late. but if its a small group, then maybe\u2026 i once went on a 7 day cruise in the Mediterranean w 3 other girls\u2026 considering we all had to travel to barcelona, hotel room for getting there a day before cruise, cruise itself, private tours that cost 700eu for each stop (this was in 2016?) and hotel to stay another night after cruise, needless to say it wasn\u2019t a cheap trip but i think if i would do it again i\u2019d want my own room\u2026 definitely being together 24/7 literally lol was driving me insane",
      "One thing i can't recommend enough before planning a trip is to actually talk about what everyone expects from the trip. \n\nKnow ahead of time how planned or spontaneous people like to be. How much money they expect to spend. How much time is going to be spent together. How much rest time vs active time you want.\n\nAdditionally, ask everyone what their \"can't miss\" experiences are. If that $200 meal at a Michelin restaurant was the reason why someone wanted to visit that city, they're  going to be upset if people argue about the price when they get there. Knowing ahead of time means it could have been budgeted for or someone who didn't want to spend that money could have made different  plans for themselves that night.\n\nAt the end of the day it's everyone's vacation and no one likes to feel like they can't do what they want to on the trip they've been looking forward to.",
      "How many people did you go with?",
      "My wife and I found it vital to set expectations from the beginning. We love traveling with people, but we\u2019re super up front about everything from the beginning. Before mentioning the idea to someone, we establish the dates, tell them where we\u2019re going, and the things that WE will do when there. We have some must do\u2019s, some want to do\u2019s, and a little flexibility.\n\nIf they want to join, great, if not, we\u2019ll have fun without them. It\u2019s important for them to understand up front what they\u2019re getting themselves into if they want to join US. \n\nOn the flip side, if we\u2019re joining someone, I want to know what their plans are. If they just want to go with the flow for ~7 days, then set low expectations as to how much or what you\u2019ll be doing.",
      "The key is similar budget, similar interests and give each other space every day. Like, don\u2019t have to eat every meal together.",
      "Not all friends are traveling/vacation friends unfortunately!! Personally I don\u2019t like to travel with anyone but my partner because when you travel or vacation with other people too many people gets in the way! Lol",
      "It can be hard traveling with your mate let alone with another couple or group of friends.At this point , I value my friendships too much to ruin them by traveling together.   If you do it, lower your expectations, be patient, and be willing to go with the flow as something even as simple as choosing a time and place to eat can be difficult.",
      "It doesn't really have anything to do with traveling with friends in general. It's more about traveling with people who are travel compatible.\n\nSome people love a schedule. I *abhor* one. \n\nNo offense OP (none at all, truly!), I would have left you to your schedule and met up later. \n\nI have friends that I don't travel with because they want to plan everything out ahead of time and deviating from any plans is the gravest of offenses. \n\nSome of the best memories of my life come from spontaneous side adventures while traveling. \n\nThe inner thought, \"Oh shit, that sounds cool.\" rarely fails me while traveling.",
      "I think the challenge is Disney. It would work if you\u2019re on a beach trip or eating your way through Italy",
      "I've travelled with friends a few time. I've learnt that you have to know their travel style well before - there WILL have to be compromises from both sides (key being both).\n\nI once did a 5 week trip with a friend - the last week was definitely testing us but we got through it - we've never travelled together again though. I've got 5/6 days with a few other friends regularly and it's always been great.",
      "Nah, traveling with the wrong friends is a bad idea. I went to Spain with 2 of my sisters and my best friend and we had a blast.",
      "Different friends, Different types of trips. I have adventure cat friends that I can do international backpack and go travel with, and I have indoor cat friends who would like to sleep till noon and a beach and cocktail every single day. Comfort levels also matter, you have to know if this is a person who can sleep next to you on a bus for 10 hours or if the person you're traveling with just cannot be inconvenienced by anything lower than a 3 star hotel. You just have to do the right trips with the right people. Also, always be willing to break from the pack and do your own thing. I have had multiple vacations where I was like 'OK I will meet you for dinner' and just went.",
      "in everyone\u2019s defense, Disney is extremely stressful and a horrible vacation spot haha",
      "There is only one friend I travel with internationally-I simply choose not to travel with friends. I like my own time, my own space and if I am spending $, I want to do what I want to do and when I want to do it. And I HATE not doing some excursion because a friend does not really have the $, so I end up paying for it or their budget is just tight in general. So, ALL (and I literally mean ALL) my friends know, I am not a team player when it comes to traveling. Do you and let me do me. If you don\u2019t want to join in an activity-not a problem-and respect it when I say no, I am doing ABC. Besides, I can only take \u201ccompany\u201d for so long-lol-then I want to be left alone in silence. lol Hey, at least they know the deal and I keep it \ud83d\udcaf.",

      "After travelling with life-long friends,  I\u2019d be inclined not to do it again.  It took a while for me to forget the pent-up stuff, after the trip was over. Their little annoying idiosyncrasies.  We all have little annoying ways. I\u2019m pretty confident they felt the same way about me. There wasn\u2019t enough time apart scheduled. We should have split up more often for some alone time.\n\nI would prefer to just travel with my wife or our dearest, closest, other family members who we know super well.  I\u2019d say my list has only 3 people on it who I\u2019d travel with.  Wife and 2 others in the family.  \nMy wife and I are so tuned-in, we travel like 1. She\u2019s up for anything that I want to do. I plan and make time for things I know she\u2019d like to do.  Its great.",

      "I prefer trips with friends to have a few major things we all do together and the rest is free time for all.  Hang out or not, and then have a few things planned. I find the fewer the expectations, less drama.  \n\nI also agree, similar budget is imperative!  And similar taste in food. If your friend likes to eat like a 5 year old and live in chicken nuggets and you prefer dim sum, it's not fun either.",
      "People always talk about taking vacations with friends and I don't understand it all. Maybe a cruise where if they sleep until noon you can still do whatever you want. That's about it.",
      "Just because you want a schedule to cram everything in doesn\u2019t mean they want to do the same. \n\nWhy can\u2019t people go away together and do whichever bits they want to and not stick to someone else\u2019s itinerary?\n\nWhen my friends and I go away we have a vague outline of a plan but people do what they want. \n\nSpending all that money on a trip that\u2019s supposed to be fun and then it being run like a boot camp sounds miserable.",
      "I could hardly wait to be rushed out of something I was enjoying, because it just didn't fit into someone else's schedule. When I go on vacation, I am looking to enjoy myself and relax. If I was looking for a schedule, I'd check the email my employer sends it to each month.",

If you want to get around the city like Audubon park, lower garden district or Bayou St John or Treme it\u2019s not the most walking friendly and in the summer it would be unbearable. There is the street car which can take you to a good amount of places. But Uber and Lyft are also readily available and easy to use",

They have buses but we didn't really use them. Can always rent a bicycle too. Uber is available if you're under a time constraints and need to be somewhere faster. \n\nAlso if you plan on seeing a plantation or alligator boat rides.

      "Yes, extremely, but be cautious.  I absolutely love New Orleans, but it is an area where wandering off in the wrong neighborhood can land you in trouble (the site of my extremely polite mugging) and there are areas you shouldn't be walking in late at night.  Generally the locals will tell you where they are though.  I was there solo one time for a job interview, asked the bartender if it was fine for me to be walking back along Tchopitoulas back to my hostel in the Garden District, and he was like \"um... no.\"\n\nBut the main tourist areas are plenty walkable particularly during the day, and the streetcar connects the Garden District to the French Quarter, which is handy.\n\nI wouldn't go during Mardi Gras.  It's absolutely insane.  And particularly as you're from Europe, don't going during the summer.  It is like walking on the surface of the sun if the surface of the sun were humid.\n\nIt's a fantastic fun city though, and the music comes from everywhere.  It is not uncommon to have buskers on the street with separate people dancing in the street to the buskers.  I'm glad it's getting some life back after Katrina, since seeing it mid destruction (my relatives used to live there) was awful.",

Like I had a great time, did amazing things, met great people and ate awesome food, but it is never as good in reality as in my head?\n\nI've struggled with this for years and I've come to realise the problem. It's not a place I want to visit, it's a place in a certain time that's been romanticised and in fact, no longer exists. The modern world has taken much of the beauty and individuality from almost everywhere now. \n\nI know there's no solution, but wondered if I was alone in this and either way I just wanted to get it off my chest. \n\nI wonder how many places remain that I've perhaps romanticised. I know some of them do, now I need to point my travel towards those. \n\nIf anyone invents time travel, hit me up. ",

      "I kind of know what you\u2019re talking about. A lot of the world has been globalised. With that being said, when you start travelling more off the beaten path, that sense of wonder/singular ness will be present.",
      "Since forever, writers have attempted to make their travel stories interesting, and they tend to exaggerate. it's not necessarily \"romanticization\" but just storytelling, and an interesting story is often better than the mundane reality - or is it? An element of reality is your attitude about it.",
      "No, because culture is not static. I do not want to visit a place that is stuck in time so I can just be a voyeur of non-modernized locales. \n\nLook- I think I get what you\u2019re saying in a sense. Globalization absolutely homogenizes cultures. And there are absolutely many other negative impacts as well which are beyond the scope of this thread. However, if given the choice between a more isolated but culturally pristine locale versus a less isolated and more homogenized place that has more opportunities for its people due to modernization, then no, I would not want to go back in time.",
      "Modern life is alienating. I think you\u2019re perhaps looking for less of that when you travel and just not finding it or finding the sense of alienation goes with you.",
      "This sounds like a you problem.",
      "I think this is a really important observation. Very often, tourists decide to visit a location because of a literary link, for instance, Long Island and F. Scott Fitzgerald (The Great Gatsby), Columbia and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Cuba and Hemingway etc. When tourists finally visit the site in question, they're often disappointed because it hasn't been 'preserved in aspic'.  In other words, it's moved with the times and the features that made it special are now diluted, sometimes to the point of non-existence.\n\nFor what it's worth, I think it's useful to manage tourists' expectations. Traipsing around an African village full of mud huts might be picturesque for tourists but the inhabitants are understandably likely to desire better conditions. Tourists should be made aware of this dilemma. The 'trick' is to provide a tourist experience that is reasonably authentic while simultaneously increasing the quality of life for the people living at the tourist site.",
      "\" ...it's never as good in reality as it is in my head.\" Have you considered that the root of the problem may be in your head?  No place, or person, or event is unmixed perfection.

Travel is a great way to dislodge us out of our existing headspace and appreciate things in the new light.",

Just drop your expectations and appreciate places as they are.\n\nEdit - Edinburgh Scotland is one place that surpassed any expectations.",

      "Maybe you should try not overthinking travel and trying to fit it into some ideal.",
      "A more stoic approach to travelling might help. Accepting what is outside of your control and focusing on what you can control. There is so much beauty in travel when you can let go of any preconceived expectations and just focus on the experience in the now. Not everything has to be fantastic. Focus on the small things that bring you joy. Acknowledge things you don't enjoy, but don't let them linger for long.",
      "Sounds like a you thing, and I don't mean that to be rude. Travel with fewer expectations. I learned that early travelling to more off-the-beaten-path places. Also don't let external stuff shape your opinion of a place. Gotta see yourself.\u00a0\n\n\nI'd suggest more nature, more hostels. Might help.\u00a0",
      "I mean, yeah, to a degree the places they used to be never existed, and part of me gets sad when I visit places like, say, Venice, which now has throngs of tourists and modern chain stores\u2026.\u00a0\n\nBut then I research the history and realize that during the gloriously romantic past, there were livestock like cows pooping in the streets, winters were damp and miserable without central heating which meant buildings were rife with mould, people dumped their refuse in the stinking canals, and because it had to get exported to the mainland due to water shortages, they did their laundry only about twice a year.\u00a0\n\nSo I\u2019ll take the present, thanks.",

Quite the opposite actually.\n\nThe one time I was really disapointed was when a co-worker told me that Langkawi, Malaysia was amazing. Turns out he and his wife stayed in a 5-star resort and didn't leave it. Amazing, sure! My wife and I stayed in a 3-star hotel there and explored the entire island, and while we had fun, we were a bit underwhelmed. And that was my fault for having false expectations based on somebody else's experience.",
      "Not really. I find that if I travel with a mix of everything, I enjoy everything to the fullest everywhere I go. As soon as one place peaks I\u2019m onto the next. For e.g. my last trip to euro one section of my trip I went Swiss for 2 weeks, enjoyed the nature, then Italy 2 weeks,\nEnjoyed the food, history & architecture then Greece for 2 weeks to enjoy the beaches and relax..then rinse & repeat. If I get too much of the same thing, I start to get bored and maybe appreciate the places a little less whereas if everything is fresh & new. If that kinda makes sense. I think this idea of things were better in the past is kinda dumb. People in the past had different problems, and say even if they were what you gona do about it? So many people romanticise things in their heads and never get to see what it actually is. You seem to be privileged enough to actually play it out, and experience it.

It was a fun surprise to learn the history and culture. Have you thought that maybe if you travel a lot you may be a little numb to it?",
      "Nope. History is history and now is now. How geography, urban design, societies exist because of that history will always be fascinating to me.",
      "Modernity definitely plays a role, I think. For me anyway. When I see/hear parents travel photos and stories from the seventies I realise just how much the world and tourism has changed. They nearly died multiple times but they also saw stuff like the Taj Mahal with no one else around. Luxor Temple - just them (was actually a pretty dangerous situation). Palace of Versailles: one other tourist. And so on. My mom can't stand what the Seychelles or the Philippines look like now (touristy, built up, decimated nature compared to what she saw). I remind myself that tourism keeps some of these places preserved as no one would have the money to keep them as they were otherwise, but I think it's not all in your head. Mass tourism and social media expectations combined has really screwed us. I have started assuming that anything that is hyped may quite possibly be a disappointment and try to plan around my more niche interests than \"top sights in Paris\" etc.\n\nDepending on the cause of your feeling of disappointment this may or may not help. Places I can recommend that did not disappoint me and felt otherworldly:\n\nHumahuaca, Argentina: absolutely incredible colorful mountains but pay attention to what time of day is best to see them as the color depends on the angle of the light.\nPurmamarca also worth seeing but far more touristy.\n\nIrusha, Argentina - mind blowing mountains, very few tourists. In the afternoon the mountains magically seem to become colorful (as long as it's not overcast as the colours are a result of the angle of the sun hitting mountains corroded to lower level minerals exposed by the strong winds). \n\nIguazu Falls, Argentina: you need to make sure it's a good season so that the falls are full, also super busy with tourists but still more amazing than I was expecting. And the masses of butterflies were really unexpected!\n\nCappadocia, Turkey. Again, incredible mountains (I like unusual mountains as you can maybe tell). The hot air balloon ride was nice but not as incredible as I'd heard. Maybe I'm just not a person who cares about seeing stuff from the top that much. I loved looking up at them from the ground though and the mountains and caves were...like being on Mars.\n\nChobe National Park, Botswana...amazing if you love animals (haven't been to the Okavango Delta yet but it's on my bucket list). A whole lot more national parks in Africa than I love, but I guess you've got to want to see lots of animals to love it.\n\nBlyde River Canyon, South Africa. Three Rondavels mountains. The start of the official viewpoint gets crowded but the you can keep walking and find quiet spots. Also a lovely area for hiking or road tripping.\n\nLake District, UK: amazing if you love lakes, fairytale mossy forests, adorable English villages (some more crowded with tourists than others, June - August is too busy with local tourism), cream tea, cutest shops, and day hikes.\n\nIn terms of old town European cities, Innsbruck, Austria, Krakow, Poland and Czesky Krumlov, Czech Republic, were very pleasant surprises. I certainly hadn't really heard much about them so I was surprised instead of having expectations.\n\nFood: I've reached the stage where I assume that if it's food in a tourist district, it will be average to bad \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d Any place that gets a lot of hype doesn't rely on repeat customers so the food can be as crap as they like. All my worst meals were in tourist hotspots.",

You\u2019re always trying to reach that next great high\u2026 and sometimes it\u2019s hard to find the next one if you\u2019ve already done some really amazing things.  Nothing lives up to your expectations.  Had a pretty tough one over the summer- went on an Alaskan cruise, that I had planned for 21 friends and family.  I had anticipated Glacier Bay to be incredibly magnificent and it ended up being a foggy, rainy disappointment and the mountain ranges were nothing to write home about.  Whale watching was pretty boring.  Canoeing to a glacier was just ok.  It was a really expensive disappointment to my entire family.  But I\u2019m still searching for that next amazing high.",

      "If you want a time capsule experience, Cuba is probably your best bet.",
      "I think a lot of it also has to do with how easy it is to get regional content, so it's easy to develop a biased interpretation as you would be gravitated towards content favourable to you. The persona self-perpetuates.\n\nThe other thing spoiling that effect is how global brands are now.",
      "It helps to travel to places many don't go to. For example don't go to Costa Rica, go to Guatemala. It's hard to have preconceived notions about a place that nobody has romanticized yet. Then try to go off the beaten path although this is best done with a friend or two. I have been to places in Latin America where foreign visitors are very rare and where I felt like I had traveled back in time to the 50s. Then, whenever you find yourself in a popular destination and it's packed with tourists, usually there's a place just around the corner that is just as spectacular and there's nobody in it. Also India never disappoints. It's hard to get used to but once it sinks in you will feel like you have one foot in the present day and the other foot 800 years in the past.",
      "I used to be disappointed sometimes. But now I see the present and modernity as a continuation of history. I went to the Chopin Museum in Poland recently and it struck me how similar the 1800s were to today. Those on a Grand Tour were complaining about the spots they visited in their travellogues, and the Neoclassics were trying hard to look at the idealised past and shunning their modernity. Yet, when we look back at those times, we see something worth looking at, learning about.\n\nModernity, thus, is not a clash with the past, but a continuation of it. I try to experience the contemporary and futuristic elements of a country as part of my visit.",

      "I understand what you\u2019re saying. I just always readjust my mindset if a place isn\u2019t what I expect (and try to focus/appreciate the good things I wasn\u2019t expecting). \n\nI prefer to travel to developing/underdeveloped/non-western countries for the exact reason you state and have found them satisfying enough. I, too, am trying to find those places but also don\u2019t mind stumbling along from country to country until I find these places. Really love Albania & just got back from Georgia (the country) & Armenia. I\u2019m hoping the \u201cStans\u201d will provide me a decent slice of this so planning to go to a few next year.

I was looking at a trip staying with a local tribe in Guatemala learning their language, their way of life, and I'm starting to think that might open my eyes a bit about what the true issue is. I might just be over analysing and over philosophising at this point, but the conversation in the comments has got the cogs whirring.",

Similar experience in Ha Long bay. They're not mountains but the vistas are some of the most beautiful things I've ever seen - that's one place that certainly didn't disappoint.",

I was 28 at the time and had not been especially \"lucky\" when it came to finding love in my life (note: I had known this amazing girl for a number of years, and we were good friends. So when I asked her out, it felt fairly natural and easy.) As it happened, we were a great match. In April, two months into our romantic relationship, she asked me if I wanted to travel with her to Ireland for her cousin's wedding in early July. I immediately accepted her offer. We spent ten days traveling the West Coast, cavorting with her extended family as well as spending amazing time on our own in what seemed to me to be the most beautiful place on Earth. Doolin, Galway, Clare, the Cliffs of Moher, the Aran Islands. Every bar we went into we made a friend. Every B&B owner acted as if they had known us for our entire lives. My advice is this: be yourselves. Ireland and her people will meet you where you are at. I knew at the end of that long-ago trip that the woman I was with was destined to be my wife. And that is why I proposed to her and married her not long after our Ireland adventure. Have a wonderful time in Ireland and may health and happiness be your tripmates!",

      "Some not so obvious advice lol \n\nFood shops generally close fairly early and open later (compared to the US) so if you need snacks for an early morning or late night, plan ahead. \n\nIf you order a pint of Guinness, don\u2019t just drink the head off it first.\n\nIreland is getting more and more cashless by the day, almost every single place will take Apple Pay or card. \n\nYou pump your gas first, then you go inside and pay.\n\nYou typically get up and pay for your meal with the host when you are done eating at a restaurant. It\u2019s uncommon to get a bill and have the waiter come take your card. Unless you specifically ask. \n\nAccents will vary greatly as you move through the country! If you make it to the very north of Donegal or the west of Galway there will be a lot Irish spoken but most people do speak English too. \n\n\nIf your dates are flexible, I\u2019d advise early September. It\u2019s always the most consistent weather. Typically sunny and warmer as the kids go back to school. \n\nSome of the gas stations have the BEST delis. Make sure to stop for a sandwich or hot chicken roll when you\u2019re on the road. \n\nThe west side of Ireland is the best side (I\u2019m slightly bias but it\u2019s the truth lol) \n\nRent the smallest car possible if you\u2019re planning on driving country roads.\n\nDo NOT drive fast past horses on the roads. Pull over, stop and let them pass. People often ride their horses on the country roads.\n\nPeople also walk the very small country roads, take it easy going around bends. Animals are often in the road, or you can come across farmers moving sheep or cattle. Just be patient :) \n\nIt\u2019s become very common to see pop up mobile saunas at Cork beaches. (I can\u2019t speak for other counties but I\u2019m sure they have them too) I\u2019d highly recommend trying them out and taking a sea dip. \n\nHave fun! :)",
      "Weather changes hour to hour, and minute by minute.\n\nIrish people are some of the friendliest in the world.

      "Why would you go there - hideous depressing weather, so expensive, mostly ugly buildings and there still no way to get from Dublin airport to Dublin. So many better countries nearby?",

They seem quite fond of Americans and America because they spent so long seeing America as independent long before they gained theirs.\n\nThe only notable item came up during a musical pub tour was one American gent who was acting all boastful about his musical prowess and then completely bombed when he tried to play.  The performers quickly invited the next guest.\n\nWhen tourists were doing the wrong things Irish folks were quick, clear, to the point and then moved on without dwelling or holding a grudge.\n\nDo yourself a favor and seek out true Irish experiences as a lot of the pubs are playing pop western and while its familiar you would miss opportunities to experience culture.",

    "text": "Some countries are generally popular, others attract specific nationalities largely due to their proximity. However, can you name a country you've been too that most people in your country say they've gone, even if they're seasoned travelers?\n\nFor me, I haven't really been to a \"rare\" country yet because I've only visited Canada twice from the US, and then Germany, the Czech Republic and Poland earlier this year (with a layover in Ireland). All of those are pretty common. However, I am planning a trip to Cuba in the near future as an American. Even after travel to Cuba was opened up to US citizens by Obama in 2015, it's still not common for Americans to visit likely for a number of cultural and practical reasons.\n\nIn 2018, around 600,000 Americans went to Cuba compared to 1.1 Canadians (a nationality known to favor Cuba as a tourist spot). While that does put the US in second place in terms of nationality of foreign tourists, consider that the population of the US is well over 300 million, and only a fraction of a fraction of 1% of US citizens went to Cuba that year. Meanwhile, 1.1 million Canadians in Cuba isn't just nearly twice the amount of Americans, it also represents a significant portion of Canadians in general due to the population being much smaller.\n\nI'm planning to visit Cuba specifically for the unique scenery and culture, and because it's an adventurous and unorthodox destination for Americans that only recently became available at all. I'll report back here ASAP when it's done.\n\nBut that inspired me to ask this question, to see what countries Redditors here have visited that are really rare for their own nationality, even the most well-traveled?",

That was good for me, because imho Hoi An has been killed by overtourism. It felt like 9 tourists for every one local. Touts and price gouging everywhere. I had seen lots of warnings on reddit about it, hence why I only planned a half day visit. Honestly, I could have skipped it all together and been happy, though no regrets. The scooter ride from Da Nang to Hoi An was fun and made the trip worthwhile. Just a heads up, you might wanna cut Hoi An or spend less time there. \n\nFor me Hue had great vibes and the best food. Cat ba was great and Phong Nha was awesome, especially paradise cave. I recommend riding scooters around both those places for fun. Surprisingly great food in Phong Nha too, the little bakery on the main strip had awesome baked goods and banh mi. \n\nHonestly, your pace doesn't sound too crazy to me. I did something similar, like 4 days in Hanoi, 2 days in Cat ba, 2 days in ninh binh, 2 days in phong nha, 3 days in Hue, 3 days in Da nang, 3 days in Saigon and it felt perfect.

Don't cut out that day in Hue if you like to eat, see some ancient stuff and just eat around that day.\u00a0 I'd personally cut a day from Hanoi and add a day to Saigon. Don't see sights except maybe the train station, just go to food markets. You can omit hue for da nang overnight if you want a beach and better seafood dishes (Da nang has a great Cham museum).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Also when you get a junk boat, I recommend 100% to get a top 3rd one for price. I've been on maybe 4 and for not a lot in Western pricing, you'll get a bettet experience. The cheap ones are usually filled not with locals but young banana pancake tourists shittered all the time.

If that's you go wild and get a party junk boat as you'll have stories.\u00a0\n\n\nCut Da lat, it's not great and there's more Russians than Vietnamese. Add it to saigon or a day in the mekong going to a boat market or something.

I wouldn't go to other Italian cities honestly, but if you really want you can take a Frecciarossa or Italo train to Naples, it's close.\n\nDebit card: sure, cards are accepted almost everywhere. But in some smaller bars or activities they may not accept cards for purchases below 10\u20ac. You can just withdraw some cash at a bank ATM with your debit card.\nWe can't know which card you have, so you should google your debit or credit card and check if it has a foreign currency fee, or ask your bank. Usually it's 3% unless you have a premium card. \n\nAnticipate a lot of people, this is the jubilee year and June will be a crowded month in Rome.

Here\u2019s the breakdown of my approach:\n\n1. **Arrival and Initial Extension**:\n   * I\u2019ll arrive for the initial 30-day stay.\n   * On the same day, I\u2019ll apply the 59-day extension at the Bureau of Immigration (BI) office in NAIA,\n2. **Further Extensions and ACR-I Card**:\n   * One week before my 59-day stay expires, I\u2019ll visit the BI office in Intramuros or another branch to extend for 6-months.\n3. **Long-Term Stays**:\n   * After the first 6-month extension, I\u2019ll continue to renew my visa for another 6 months as needed.\n   * If I reach the 3-year limit for tourist visa extensions, I\u2019ll plan a visa run to a nearby country (e.g., Singapore or Malaysia) and return to renew my visa.\n\nDoes this plan align with current procedures, and are there any recommendations or potential issues I should be aware of? Also, has anyone used **online extension options** so that I wouldn't have to be in-person for these extensions? Any insights or tips would be greatly appreciated!",

    "title": "$1k+ AirBnb \u201cMarijuana Smoke Wall Swab Test\u201d Scam (Upheld)",
    "text": "I have been a digital nomad for over a decade so have used AirBnb 8 or 10 times over the years, normally for pretty lengthy stays. Last year the completely ruined a Europe trip for me with 3 of the 4 hosts screwing me over (all 3 still on the site fwiw.)\n\nThis recent scam is such a joke I thought it needed to be shared here. To be honest they asked for so much money at first I wasn\u2019t even worried about it as it was so obvious. Silly me.\n\nWhile traveling to one of the islands in Thailand I booked a room right on the beach. I messaged the host first to ask a few questions, she instantly sends me a warning about no smoking in the room and I say no problem and book because I am not a smoker. The host sends me about a dozen other warning messages of things that aren\u2019t allowed. No problems with any, but it did seem odd to be nailed with so many potential violations months in advance.\n\nI get to the place, it is a tiny (under 100 sq foot) apartment like you often find in Asia. As I look around I notice a lot of odd stuff, like there are 3 smoke detectors, the one that all the units have and then 2 they added. One is in the bathroom, the other is on the balcony. There are nearly a dozen no smoking signs, you can see half a dozen no matter where you stand in the place.\n\nWhy do we need 3 smoke detectors in the tiniest apartment I have ever seen? Who puts a smoke detector on a sea facing balcony where the constant sea breeze blows away any smoke instantly?\n\nI also notice I smell smoke when sitting in my room, I go look down and the guy below me is sitting on his balcony smoking. Odd for a building that has so many no smoking signs, but I barely smell it because of the obvious sea breeze.\n\nOn my second day I get a notice that if I smoke in the room again I will be evicted. I tell them I did not smoke, they send me some official building notice, and I start taking daily photos of the guy smoking below me in case they actually try to evict me.\n\nThis host is a pain in the ass to deal with throughout, they didn\u2019t have everything the room needed but I eventually just quit asking them to bring it because I can tell they are nuts and I don\u2019t want to deal with crazy people. I will spare you those details.\n\nSo my time ends, I check out, but I don\u2019t leave a review because I can feel something coming and don\u2019t want to look petty when I need to defend myself. And what a surprise, they claim I smoked in the unit, it took 7 days to clean (this tiny ass place), and it cost them well over a thousand dollars to clean it.\n\nI know AirBnb and their wonderful hosts have done their best to make absurd cleaning fees the norm, but for those that are unaware you can hire a live in maid for 3 to 4 months for that amount of money in Thailand. The place didn\u2019t smell like smoke at all, the constant sea breeze made sure of that. And if it somehow did (it didn\u2019t), it was clearly from the guy who smoked 10 times a day below me.\n\nI explain all of this to AirBnb, I upload the 20 photos of the guy smoking on different dates, and I assume this will be rejected in a day or two. In my mind they asked for such a ridiculous amount of money that they overplayed their hand and it could never go through.\n\nWell, I was kind of right. After I said I wouldn\u2019t pay they talked it over again and said OK you only owe 2/3's. I (obviously) tell them that the scammers won\u2019t be getting a penny from me.\n\nAt this time my card on file gets frozen because it was scammed somewhere else. The bank shuts the card down, so there is no payment method. But I have to pay for my next place on AirBnb and the deadline is coming.\n\nFor 3 weeks I try to use chat support, I try to call in through wifi via the website, I try the 1-800 numbers. Every time I am told I cannot call anyone in claims, they have to call me. I go out and buy a sim card and update my phone number, I start a chat with front line support confirming they have my current phone number. No phone call ever comes.\n\nThey close the case saying I owe nearly a grand. I tell them I will never add a payment method until this is lifted. And this is where it sits, I had to find a new place off AirBnb last minute and my next host got screwed because they can\u2019t get anything resolved in a timely manner.\n\nAll along it was very clear they had no idea what was going on and had no intention of finding out. And it is no surprise they side with the property owner at the end.\n\nBased on what? Well, they have the word of the property owner. They have the word of the cleaning staff (so they say.) And they have a \u2018marijuana smoke smell wall swab test.\u2019\n\nYes, they claim the hosts used some swab that showed proof of marijuana smoke in the room. I try to point out a few obvious things here. The first being WTF are you talking about? The second being, even if somehow this is legit (it ain\u2019t), it doesn\u2019t prove when it was smoked, where it was smoked, who smoked it, or that I had anything to do with it.\n\nMy 20 photos of the guy right below me smoking on different dates mean nothing. My history of having stayed in AirBnb\u2019s for probably close to a year with no one ever claiming I left a room smelling like smoke or mentioning smoke at all are meaningless. The property owner says it is so so it is so. Oh ya, and the \u2018marijuana smoke smell wall swab test.\u2019\n\n\u00a0AirBnb has turned into the modern Craigslist. It is a cesspool that has attracted more scammers than anywhere. It has been the biggest causer of stress in my life over the past 2 years since I started using it more frequently. None of the shitty hosts from the past who AirBnb has been told have screwed me over (and they can often see their lies right there in the chat) have been removed from the site. Only my reviews exposing them have.\n\nMy advice, don\u2019t use any kind of payment method you want to keep long term on AirBnb. Be ready to close that account when a scam comes. At least the banks and credit card companies have had to deal with this crap so often they know it is coming and will usually have your back.\n\nTake pictures and videos of everything when you check in. And if something doesn't smell right mention it to AirBnb ahead of time. If you wait til after the fact the property owner is the only opinion they care about.",

      "I am also a long term nomad, and I can't work out for the life of me why you would ever use AirBnB in the first place, especially in Asia. I often compare listings to Booking and Agoda, and not once have I found a better deal on AirBnB. It's always more expensive, the terms are always more restrictive, the added fees are more confusing and it's always more difficult getting people to respond to enquiries. On top of that, AirBnb has completely fucked up rental markets across the world. Boycott this shitty company.",
